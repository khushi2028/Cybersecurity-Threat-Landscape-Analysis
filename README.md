# 📊 Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Analysis  

---

## 🔍 Problem  
Organizations across industries struggle to anticipate and prioritize cybersecurity risks due to limited visibility into **historical and emerging cyberattack trends**.  
This lack of visibility makes it difficult to allocate budgets effectively, prepare employees, and invest in the right defenses.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal  
Develop an **analytics product** that:  
- Identifies **industries most vulnerable** to attacks.  
- Highlights the **attack vectors** most commonly used (phishing, ransomware, malware, etc.).  
- Measures **financial & operational impact** (losses, downtime, affected users).  
- Provides **predictive insights for 2025+** to help CISOs, IT Managers, and policymakers make data-driven security investments.
